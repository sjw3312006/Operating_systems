# Operating_systems
This project broadly aims to give an understanding of what a modern operating system is, and the services it provides. It also discusses some basic issues in operating systems and provides solutions. Topics include multiprogramming, process management, memory management, and file systems.

# Project of List Implementation

For this project, I have implemented the List abstract data type. The list data structure is widely used throughout operating system programming. This project helped my list skills onto UNIX and into C programming.

I have created the user-defined type List. An instance of this type refers to a particular list and will be an argument to most of your list manipulation routines. As with all code that is written for operating systems, the goal here is efficiency.

## Make file
This project contains a makefile :
###
      “make”: builds the program
      “make clean”: erases all build products
